  Solution:
</div>
<div class="text">
  CrytpSky analyzed all aspects of customer request and concluded, that the most efficient way to reach the goal is by providing individualized content for each customer based on his or her purchases and view log. The first step included clustering of customer products into related categories based on the probability of cross-sale from the customer’s history. In the next step, CrytpSky developed the machine-learning algorithms, that adjusted the categories score for products and product categories for each customer, based on recent customer’s activity. For this project we setup a team of a Full Stack Web Developer, Data Scientist and Scrum Master. The project was completed in 5 months.
