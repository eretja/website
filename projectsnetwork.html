<div class="text">
  The Client – large international social network platform, that targeted a very specific market segment and has been established in 2005, has been looking for a team of developers and consultants to increase their market share, improve UI and UX and improve overall platform performance and security.

<div class="text">

  CrytpSky took on responsibilities for the full scale technical support. We also provided consultancy  in redesigning some parts of user interface and user experience on the platform. We worked closely with the Client’s digital marketing and customer insights team to ensure the best outcome. In this assignment we used agile project management  technique. On our site we setup a team of a Front End developer, Backend developer and a Project Manager.

  Result:

<div class="text">

  After the roll-out of the new platform design, the previously agreed KPIs have been met - the Client reported that the average time on platform has almost doubled and the number of active daily users has increased significantly. The Client was able to raise the funds to launch an intensive marketing campaign for the platform. CryptSky continue to support all technical operations, new platform features and marketing approaches are being discussed with the client to advance initial platform success.​
